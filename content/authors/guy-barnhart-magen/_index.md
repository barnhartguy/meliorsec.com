He is currently a Cyber Security Consultant, focusing on **OS and Services Hardening, Cryptography, AI Security, and Reverse Engineering**.

Guy is the [BSidesTLV](https://bsidestlv.com) chairman and [CTF](https://bsidestlv.com/ctf/) lead, a Public speaker, and the recipient of the Cisco “black belt” security ninja honor – Cisco’s highest cyber security advocate rank.

Starting out as a software developer for security startups and later spent 8 years in the IDF. After completing his degrees in Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics, he focused on **security research**, in the real world.

He joined [NDS](https://nds.com/) (later acquired by [Cisco](https://cisco.com/)) and led the **Anti-Hacking, Cryptography and Supply Chain Security** Groups (~25 people in US and Israel).
